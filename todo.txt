  1. Create a repository that will house your application
    - Variations:
      + you can create 1 repository that holds both the API and the UI, but keep them on separate branchs
      + you can create 2 repositories, one for the API and another for the UI
      + DO NOT KEEP THE SOURCE CODE LOGIC FOR THE API AND UI IN THE SAME FOLDER
  2. Make an initial commit with basic project structure to the repositories
    - Don't overthink this: 
      + Make a simple Express API with a exposed test endpoint, commit and push
      + Make a simple UI with a index.html, commit and push
  3. Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application that will be used to deploy the Express API
    - Environment: NodeJS 12
    - Start it up with the sample application that AWS suggests by default
  4. Add environment variables to the EB application
    - EB application instantiation must be complete
    - Go to the application dashboard and choose "Configuration", click "Edit" for the Software configuration option
    - Scroll down to "Environment properties" and add all required variables
  5. Create an AWS S3 bucket that will be used to host the UI application
    - The S3 bucket must be configured properly for static web hosting 
  6. Create a buildspec.yml for the API and push it to the repository
    - See revaboards for reference
  7. Create a buildspec.yml for the UI application and push it to the repository
    - See revaboards-ui for reference
  8. Use AWS CodePipeline to create the CI/CD pipeline for the UI
    - Only needs two stages: Source and Build
    - Follow AWS Console prompts to setup pipeline
    - Source: Github, choose your repository and the proper branch
    - Build: CodeBuild, follow prompts to create build project
  9. Use AWS CodePipeline to create the CI/CD pipeline for the API
    - Needs three stages: Source, Build, and Deploy
    - Follow AWS Console prompts to setup pipeline
    - Source: Github, choose your repository and the proper branch
    - Build: CodeBuild, follow prompts to create build project
    - Deploy: Elastic Beanstalk, choose the application you created earlier
